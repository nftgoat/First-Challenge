## My Tasks

I refracted the code. I changed up a lot of the divs, and replaced them with more visually pleasing code. This code is more user friendly. **Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
